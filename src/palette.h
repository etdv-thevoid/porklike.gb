// When a mob is flashing, it is either because it has a key, or was recently
// hit. They are meant to have different behavior; when a mob is hit it will
// stay white for MOB_FLASH_FRAMES. But when a mob has the key, it will
// periodically flash white and then back to normal.
//
// On DMG, we use OBP1 (i.e. `S_PALETTE` below) for both, and change the
// palette colors periodically. This means that sometimes a hit mob won't
// appear white for the full MOB_FLASH_FRAMES.
//
// On CGB, we can do better and use separate palettes for each of these.
